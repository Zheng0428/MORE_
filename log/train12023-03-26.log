All model checkpoint weights were used when initializing GeneralizedRCNN.

All the weights of GeneralizedRCNN were initialized from the model checkpoint at unc-nlp/frcnn-vg-finetuned.
If your task is similar to the task the model of the checkpoint was trained on, you can already use GeneralizedRCNN for predictions without further training.
LXRT encoder with 9 l_layers, 5 x_layers, and 5 r_layers.
